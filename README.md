Podsync - is a simple, free service that lets you listen to any YouTube / Vimeo channels, playlists or user videos in
podcast format.

Podcast applications have a rich functionality for content delivery - automatic download of new episodes,
remembering last played position, sync between devices and offline listening. This functionality is not available
on YouTube and Vimeo. So the aim of Podsync is to make your life easier and enable you to view/listen to content on
any device in podcast client.

## Features

- Works with YouTube and Vimeo.
- Supports feeds configuration: video/audio, high/low quality, max video height, etc.
- mp3 encoding
- Update scheduler supports cron expressions
- Episodes filtering (match by title).
- Feeds customizations (custom artwork, category, language, etc).
- OPML export.
- Supports episodes cleanup (keep last X episodes).
- One-click deployment for AWS.
- Runs on Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and Docker.
- Supports ARM.
- Automatic youtube-dl self update.
- Supports API keys rotation.
- Can update a plex server if you have a library set up to receive the content from podsync.

## Dependencies

If you're running the CLI as binary (e.g. not via Docker), you need to make sure that dependencies are available on
your system. Currently, Podsync depends on `youtube-dl` and `ffmpeg`.

On Mac you can install those with `brew`:
```
brew install youtube-dl ffmpeg
```

### Access tokens

In order to query YouTube or Vimeo API you have to obtain an API token first.

- [How to get YouTube API key](https://elfsight.com/blog/2016/12/how-to-get-youtube-api-key-tutorial/)
- [Generate an access token for Vimeo](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/guides/start#generate-access-token)

## Configuration

You need to create a configuration file (for instance `config.toml`) and specify the list of feeds that you're going to host.
See [config.toml.example](./config.toml.example) for all possible configuration keys available in Podsync.

Minimal configuration would look like this:

```toml
[server]
port = 8080
data_dir = "/data/podsync/"

[tokens]
youtube = "PASTE YOUR API KEY HERE"

[mediaserver]
url = "http://<plex server address>:<port> (assume 32400)"
token = "<plex token here>" #See https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/
library = <library section ID> #Similar process to x-plex-token, but in the xml that is showing look for librarySectionID=xx

[feeds]
    [feeds.ID1]
    url = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxC5Ls6DwqV0e-CYcAKkExQ"
```

If you want to hide Podsync behind reverse proxy like nginx, you can use `hostname` field:

```toml
[server]
port = 8080
hostname = "https://my.test.host:4443"

[feeds]
  [feeds.ID1]
  ...
```

Server will be accessible from `http://localhost:8080`, but episode links will point to `https://my.test.host:4443/ID1/...`
